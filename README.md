# javaSwingRandomizer
A basic swing program that allows the user to enter tables of information and generate randomized lists from them.

This is a very besic project that primarily served as a way for me to acquaint myself with the Swing library. As a result, I hand-coded all of the Swing code - not an easy task, truthfully. I do still use this program regularly, however.

Note that the randomTables.ser file *must* be in the same folder as the .jar file - it stores the tables entered into the program.
